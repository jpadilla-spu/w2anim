# Change Log - The W2 Animator

All notable changes to The W2 Animator (W2Anim) will be logged to this file.


### [v0.9.1](https://github.com/sarounds/w2anim/releases/tag/v0.9.1) \[11-May-2023\]

This update fixes a few bugs and adds an initialization file and the [User
Manual](https://github.com/sarounds/w2anim/blob/main/src/user_manual/W2Anim_manual.pdf).

#### Changed

- Code was added to ensure that group tags would be preserved when graph
  elements were updated. The previous version sometimes lost the group tags
  when graphs were updated, causing a group move action, for example, to
  "splinch" the object and not move the parts together.

- Code was modified to ensure that axis limits for linked time-series
  graphs were initialized properly when certain units were chosen.

- Code was modified to catch an aborted action to create a PDF file.

#### Added

- Code was added to read a w2anim.ini initialization file.

- The first edition of the [User
  Manual](https://github.com/sarounds/w2anim/blob/main/src/user_manual/W2Anim_manual.pdf)
  was completed.


### [v0.9.0](https://github.com/sarounds/w2anim/releases/tag/v0.9.0) \[24-Apr-2023\]

Version 0.9.0 was the original release.
